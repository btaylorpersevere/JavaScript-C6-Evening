//In JavaScript and other programming languages \ followed by some characters is an escape sequence. Let's see the most common escape characters:

\n: new line
\t: Tab, means 8 spaces
\\: Back slash
\': Single quote (')
\": Double quote (")

console.log('I hope everyone is enjoying the 30 Days Of JavaScript challenge.\nDo you ?') // line break
console.log('Days\tTopics\tExercises')
console.log('Day 1\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 2\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 3\t3\t5')
console.log('Day 4\t3\t5')
console.log('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') // To write a backslash
console.log('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"')
console.log("In every programming language it starts with \'Hello, World!\'")
console.log('The saying \'Seeing is Believing\' isn\'t correct in 2020')

//Template Literals (Template Strings)
To create a template strings, we use two back-ticks. We can inject data as expressions inside a template string. To inject data, we enclose the expression with a curly bracket({}) preceded by a $ sign. See the syntax below.

//Syntax
`String literal text`
`String literal text ${expression}`

console.log(`The sum of 2 and 3 is 5`)              // statically writing the data
let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`The sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a + b}`) // injecting the data dynamically

let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
let country = 'Finland'
let city = 'Helsinki'
let language = 'JavaScript'
let job = 'teacher'
let age = 250
let fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

let personInfoTwo = `I am ${fullName}. I am ${age}. I live in ${country}.` //ES6 - String interpolation method
let personInfoThree = `I am ${fullName}. I live in ${city}, ${country}. I am a ${job}. I teach ${language}.`
console.log(personInfoTwo)
console.log(personInfoThree)


// Using a string template or string interpolation method, we can add expressions, which could be a value, or some operations (comparison, arithmetic operations, ternary operation

let a = 2
let b = 3
console.log(`${a} is greater than ${b}: ${a > b}`)
